  <h1>Michelle's Hobbies</h1>
  <p>I can't wait to share with you what my hobbies are!
    I feel, hobbies are one of the way to dig more about yourself, to embrace yourself.
    So, recently I am kind of into slow-motion art, like, caligraphy, and a bit of painting.
  </p>

  <p>Yes, Caligraphy. I've been wanted to try this. So one day, here comes the chance
    where I able to learn it in half price. >.< . What do you waiting for? of couse YES!
    Caligraphy do make me feel calm, stay away from all the troubles.
  </p>

  <p>Another recent hobby is painting. Of course ain't those super great painting.
    Do you know those canvas paint by number? Literally, you don't need any knowledge in 
    painting. Just paint according to the number which printed on the canvas. 
    IT'S SUPER EASY! Well, this calm me too. I like to play some songs behind, and just 
    focus in painting them. 
  </p>

  <p>The last hobby is swimming. I learn it when I'm at 7 or 8 years old. I still remember
    I have wake up at 7am, being forced by my mum to go for swimming classes. Well, luckily,
    I do enjoy it at the end. Haha.
